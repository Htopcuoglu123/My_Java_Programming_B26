Iterable interface

    parent of the Collection interface

    any class that implements the Collection interface can use the iterator, which means it can use a for loop
    and create its own iterator object

    Iterator object is a way to manually iterate through the elements of the collection one at a time

    method of iterator:

        next(): moves to the next element, and returns it
        hasNext(): check if there is an element after it, returns boolean
        remove(): remove the current element from the collection

    syntax to create the object:

        Iterator<dataType> name = collection.iterator();
